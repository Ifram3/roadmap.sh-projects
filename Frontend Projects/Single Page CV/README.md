# Single-Page-CV
A minimalist, single-page CV template built using only HTML

In this project, I am required to create a single-page CV (Curriculum Vitae) using only HTML. It should look like the following image:

## Key requirements for this project:

* Semantic HTML: Use appropriate HTML tags to structure your CV.
* SEO Meta Tags: Include essential meta tags for SEO.
* Open Graph (OG) Tags: Add OG tags for better social media sharing.
* Favicon: Add a favicon for your CV page.
* The structure of your CV should be easily understandable and ready for styling in a future project.

## Submission Checklist:

* Semantically correct HTML structure.
* Single-page layout with sections for education, skills, and career history.
* SEO meta tags in the head section.
* OG tags for better social media sharing.
* A favicon linked in the head section.

## How to View the Project:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Ifram3/Single-Page-CV.git  

2. Navigate to the project directory and open the index.html file in any modern web browser.

## Technologies used:

- **HTML5** for structuring the page semantically
- **Meta Tags** and **Open Graph** for SEO and Social Media Optimization.

## Future Technologies

- Add CSS for styling and enhancing the visual appearance of the CV.
- Use Flexbox for a responsive layout.
- Add JavaScript for interactivity.

## What I Learnt

**Open Graph Tags** - Implementing open graph tags was a new challenge, which is because prior to working on the project, I didn't know about them. So I had to learn how to use them to make my CV page display correctly when shared on social media platforms like LinkedIn, Facebook, or Twitter.

**Meta Tags** - In my aim to include essential meta tags for SEO, I learnt a new one which is the robots meta tag that is used to instruct robots or search engine crawlers on how to handle the indexing and crawling of my CV page
