# Personal Portfolio

## Description
The goal of this project is to teach myself how to style a website using CSS. I am to take the structure from the [previous HTML-only project](https://github.com/Ifram3/roadmap.sh-projects/tree/main/Frontend%20Projects/Basic%20HTML%20Website) and apply various CSS techniques to enhance its appearance and responsiveness.

The focus will be on learning how to use CSS to create responsive layouts, apply color and typography, and enhance the overall design of your website. Below are the rough mockups of the website structure for mobile and desktop devices. 

**NB:** Do not worry about the design details i.e. colors backgrounds etc at this stage; we are not looking for a beautiful design, but a well-structured and responsive website. Just focus on making the layout the same as the mockup and ensuring it looks good on different screen sizes.
