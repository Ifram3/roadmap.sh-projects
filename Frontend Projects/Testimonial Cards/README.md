## Testimonial Cards

### Description
In this project, I am required to create a bunch of testimonial cards. Testimonials are quotes or statements from satisfied customers or users, often used on websites to build credibility and trust.

This project aims to teach me about positioning and layout in CSS. Below is a rough mockup showing some testimonial cards. Each card is designed to help me understand different layout and positioning techniques.

You can use any content and images you like for the testimonials.

After completing this project, I had a good understanding of how to create layouts using HTML and CSS. You can further enhance your skills by exploring more complex projects as you progress.

### How to view this project:
1. Clone the repository
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Ifram3/testimonial-cards.git
    ```
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the testimonial cards.

### Technologies used:
- **HTML5** for structuring the page semantically
- **CSS3** for styling and layout
- **Flexbox** for creating flexible and responsive layouts
- **CSS Positioning** for positioning elements relative to each other
- **Icons** to visually represent a few objects

### What I Learnt
- Creating a Downward-Facing Triangle using the `border` trick in CSS.
- Creating a Star Icon using Font Awesome. 
```html 
    <span class="fa fa-star"></span> 
```
- Creating a left and right Navigation Icons Using Google Material Icons.
```html
    <span class="material-icons">chevron_left</span>
    <span class="material-icons">chevron_right</span>
```
