# Tooltip UI

## Description 
In this project, I am required to create a tooltip that appears above navigation items when hovered, using only HTML and CSS. A tooltip is a small pop-up box that provides additional information about a navigation item when a user hovers over it. This project focused on mastering CSS positioning, hover effects, and creating visually appealing tooltips without relying on JavaScript.

The goal of this project is to help me understand how to use CSS for dynamic UI effects. I learnt how to position elements relative to each other, create smooth transitions, and make my navigation more interactive and user-friendly. Below is a rough mockup showing the tooltip appearing above a navigation item.

Bonus points for different animations for the tooltip, such as fade-in, slide-in, or scale-in effects.
