# Basic-HTML-Website

## Description
This is a foundational HTML-only project designed to showcase essential web structure and semantic tags. Ideal for beginners to understand the basics of web development and create a simple, well-structured multiple-page layout.

The goal of this project was to teach myself how to structure a website using HTML i.e. different sections of a website like header, footer, navigation, main content, sidebars, etc. I was not required to style the website, only required to focus on the structure of the website using HTML. Styling will be done in a separate project. It should look like the following image (remember, you are not required to style the website, only focus on the structure that you can style later):

## Key requirements for this project:

In this project, I was required to create a simple HTML-only website with multiple pages. The website should have the following pages:

- Homepage
- Projects
- Articles
- Contact

The website is to have a navigation bar that should be present on all pages and link to all the pages. The goals of this project are:

- Learn how to create multiple pages on a website.
- Structure a website semantically using HTML.
- Structure in a way that you can easily add styles later.
- Add SEO meta tags to the website.
